/*** 
 As a teacher, I would like to be able to be see which of my students are passing or failing, 
  so I can have a better understanding on how my students are preforming.

 *  Complete the Teacher Gradebook by using the module pattern. Use the studentGrades data that I have imported for you.

 *  1) Create the first method TeacherGradeBook.getFailingStudents which returns an array of objects of all the students that have failing the course.
 *  //TeacherGradeBook.getFailingStudents() --> [{FirstName:'Billy',lastName:'Joel',grades:[20,30,40,50]},{FirstName:'Luke',lastName:'Skywalker', grades:[0,0,0,100]}]
 *
 *  2)Create second method TeachersGradeBook.getPassingStudents() which will return an array of objects of all the students that have passed.
 *   i.e TeachersGradeBook.getPassingStudents() --> [{FirstName:'jane',lastName:'doe',grades:[100,100,100,100]},{FirstName:'James',lastName:'Bond', grades:[90,90,90,90]}]
 *
 *  3)Create third method is used to debug and will return a list of all the students.Useful for debugging purposes
 *   TeachersGradeBook.debug() --> list of all students
 *
